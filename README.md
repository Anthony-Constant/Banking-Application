	<li>Deposit amount: allows you to deposit a certain amount of coins into your account balance.</li>
	<li>Check amount: allows you to check the current balance of your account.</li>
	<li>Account info: provides information about the current account holder.</li>
	<li>Quit session: allows you to exit the application.</li>
</ul>
