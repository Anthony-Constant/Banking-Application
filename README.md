# How it works

After running the code, an account must be created before entering the banking application menu. Once an account has been created, it will present the menu options for the following actions to manipulate your initial total balance of 100 coins:

- Withdraw amount: allows you to withdraw a certain amount of coins from your account balance.
- Deposit amount: allows you to deposit a certain amount of coins into your account balance.
- Check amount: allows you to check the current balance of your account.
- Account info: provides information about the current account holder.
- Quit session: allows you to exit the application.

# How to use it

To use this banking application:

1. Run the code to create an initial account with a total balance of 100 coins.
2. Enter your name to proceed to the banking application menu.
3. Choose from the following options to manipulate your account balance: withdraw, deposit, check amount, account info, or quit session.

# Things to notice

The balance of the account will be updated after each successful deposit or withdrawal transaction. You can check the current balance at any time by selecting the "check amount" option.
